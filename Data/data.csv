I received a quick delivery from flipkart. The headphones are light weight and foldable which makes it easy to carry. Sound quality is decent. Bluetooth connectivity is very good. The only negetive aspect of this device is the call quality. It's terrible. You can hear the other person but the microphone on this device is so poor that you won't be audible on the other end. It definitely doesn't support handsfree calling. I tried using the cable to call but again it didn't improve much. This is...READ MORE,3

Hi guys I recently brought these headphone and have been using it for a while now. The headphones are just decent for the price range. I got it for under 1000 bucks. The optimal sound can be achieved through equilizer only. Pairing it is fairly easy. Battery is also decent. The ear puffs are not too comfortable. A little bigger and softer puffs would have been great. The build quality is also fairly decent. The only issue I faced was with the microphone. Others were not able to hear me proper...READ MORE,3

Writing this review after 9 days of usage:-The sound quality is rich and impressive along with the bass that makes you feel that you are in the music. Noise cancellation is also great.

Good product as it's price. Sound quality is good too but i experienced some issues after using it for few months. Whenever i watch a video the sound goes mute and i have to rewind the video to unmute it. It gives an extra wire for the headphone along with the usb. Design is rocking and well built. Keys are okay but can be improved a little bit. And battery life is good but it starts draining frequently after a little long use.READ MORE,4
